# Summer Session I 2022 Drop Data
Drop data for Summer Session I 2022. 

Note that, since enrollment has passed, there's not really a point in having this folder aside from seeing the drop rate of certain classes.

## Supported Courses
I only have enrollment data for:
- Lower- and upper-division CSE courses.
- Lower- and upper-division COGS courses.
- Lower- and upper-division ECE courses.
- Lower- and upper-division MATH courses.

## Intervals
Expect a roughly **4 minute interval** between requests to the same course. In general, there is now a 6 second delay between requests, and 40 courses to track.
